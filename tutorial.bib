abstract = {ABSTRACT Recent innovation of RNA-seq technology has shed insightful light on the transcriptomic evolution studies, especially on researches of tissue-specific expression evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of transcriptome data may help to identify causal gene expression differences underlying the evolutionary changes in morphological, physiological, and developmental characters of interest. However, there is a deficiency of software to phylogenetically analyze transcriptome data. To address this need, we have developed an R package TreeExp that can perform comparative expression evolution analysis based on RNA-seq data, which includes optimized input formatting, normalization, pairwise expression distance estimation, expression character tree inference, and preliminary expression phylogenetic network analysis. TreeExp also enables user to map expression distance onto a customized phylogenetic tree. By applying TreeExp on two cases of mammalian gene expression evolution, we observed that (1) expression trees of brain and testis are largely consistent with known mammalian species tree with minor discrepancies; (2) intertissues expression divergences (brain and testis) are more substantial than interspecies expression divergences across mammalian species; and (3) expression pattern of gene modules related to nervous system development exhibits specific expression pattern in brain of primates compared to housekeeping genes. These tissue-specific expression patterns might give insights underlying evo-devo mechanisms of complex organisms. TreeExp is released under the GPL v3 open source license, and its current stable version 1.0 is freely available at the Github developer site (https://github.com/hr1912/TreeExp).},

To this end, we report a new method of ancestral state inference. The new method used Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model, which is more biologically realistic, to replace the Brownian motion (BM) model and is suitable for multi-transcriptome data. Implemented in the free R package, AnceTran is specially designed for RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, which is feasible. It should be noticed that our work will be integrated to a unified, statistically-sound phylogenetic framework to study the evolution of many other molecular phenomes such as proteomics, chromatin accessibility, methylation status, and metabolomics.

Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals.},

Several evolutionary mechanisms are integrated to characterize the pattern of expression diversity after gene duplications, including gradual drift and dramatic shift (punctuated equilibrium). When the phylogeny of a gene family is given, we show that the likelihood function follows a multivariate normal distribution; the variance-covariance matrix is determined by the phylogenetic topology and evolutionary parameters. Maximum-likelihood methods for multiple microarray experiments are developed, and likelihood-ratio tests are designed for testing the evolutionary pattern of gene expression. To reconstruct the evolutionary trace of expression diversity after gene (or genome) duplications, we developed a Bayesian-based method and use the posterior mean as predictors.

We use genomic sequence information to connect these data and compare global and modular properties of the transcription programs. Linking genes whose expression profiles are similar, we find that for all organisms the connectivity distribution follows a power-law, highly connected genes tend to be essential and conserved, and the expression program is highly modular. We reveal the modular structure by decomposing each set of expression data into coexpressed modules. Functionally related sets of genes are frequently coexpressed in multiple organisms. Yet their relative importance to the transcription program and their regulatory relationships vary among organisms. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining sequence and expression data for improving functional gene annotation and expanding our understanding of how gene expression and diversity evolved.},

In this study, we present a theoretical framework for the study of stabilizing and directional selection using data from between-species divergence of continuous traits. This framework, based upon Brownian motion, is analytically tractable and can be used in maximum-likelihood or Bayesian parameter estimation. We apply this model to gene-expression levels in 7 species of Drosophila, and find that gene-expression divergence is substantially curtailed by stabilizing selection. However, we estimate the selective effect, s, of gene-expression change to be very small, approximately equal to Ns for a change of one standard deviation, where N is the effective population size. These findings highlight the power of natural selection to shape phenotype, even when the fitness effects of mutations are in the nearly neutral range.},

  abstract = {To maintain normal physiological functions, different tissues may have different developmental constraints on expressed genes. Consequently, the evolutionary tolerance for genomic evolution varies among tissues. Here, we formulate this argument as a “tissue-driven hypothesis” based on the stabilizing selection model. Moreover, several predicted genomic correlations are tested by the human–mouse microarray data. Our results are as follows. First, between the human and mouse, we have elaborated the among-tissue covariation between tissue expression distance (Eti) and tissue sequence distance (Dti). This highly significant Eti − Dti correlation emerges when the expression divergence and protein sequence divergence are under the same tissue constraints. Second, the tissue-driven hypothesis further explains the observed significant correlation between the tissue expression distance (between the human and mouse) and the duplicate tissue distance (Tdup) between human (or mouse) paralogous genes. In other words, between-duplicate and interspecies expression divergences covary among tissues. Third, for genes with the same expression broadness, we found that genes expressed in more stringent tissues (e.g., neurorelated) generally tend to evolve more slowly than those in more relaxed tissues (e.g., hormone-related). We conclude that tissue factors should be considered as an important component in shaping the pattern of genomic evolution and correlations.},

  abstract = {The extent to which natural selection shapes phenotypic variation has long been a matter of debate among those studying organic evolution. We studied the patterns of gene expression polymorphism and divergence in several datasets that ranged from comparisons between two very closely related laboratory strains of mice to comparisons across a considerably longer time scale, such as between humans and chimpanzees, two species of mice, and two species of Drosophila. The results were analyzed and interpreted in view of neutral models of phenotypic evolution. Our analyses used a number of metrics to show that most mRNA levels are evolutionary stable, changing little across the range of taxonomic distances compared. This implies that, overall, widespread stabilizing selection on transcription levels has prevented greater evolutionary changes in mRNA levels. Nevertheless, the range of rates of divergence is large with highly significant differences in the rate and patterns of transcription divergence across functional classes defined on the basis of the gene ontology annotation (primates and mice datasets) or on the basis of the pattern of sex-biased gene expression (Drosophila). Moreover, rates of divergence of sex-biased genes in the contrast between Drosophila species show a distinct pattern from that observed in the contrast between populations of D. melanogaster. Hence, we discuss the time scale of the changes observed and its consequences for the relationship between variation in gene expression within and between species. Finally, we argue that differences in mRNA levels of the magnitudes observed herein could be explained by a remarkably small number of generations of directional selection.},

  abstract = {Much of the phenotypic variation observed between even closely related species may be driven by differences in gene expression levels. The current availability of reliable techniques like RNA-Seq, which can quantify expression levels across species, has enabled comparative studies. Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) processes have been proposed to model gene expression evolution as they model both random drift and stabilizing selection and can be extended to model changes in selection regimes. The OU models provide a statistical framework that allows comparisons of specific hypotheses of selective regimes, including random drift, constrained drift, and expression level shifts. In this way, inferences may be made about the mode of selection acting on the expression level of a gene. We augment this model to include within-species expression variance, allowing for modeling of nonevolutionary expression variance that could be caused by individual genetic, environmental, or technical variation. Through simulations, we explore the reliability of parameter estimates and the extent to which different selective regimes can be distinguished using phylogenies of varying size using both the typical OU model and our extended model. We find that if individual variation is not accounted for, nonevolutionary expression variation is often mistaken for strong stabilizing selection. The methods presented in this article are increasingly relevant as comparative expression data becomes more available and researchers turn to expression as a primary evolving phenotype.},

  abstract = {TATA box, the core promoter element, exists in a broad range of eukaryotes, and the expression of TATA-containing genes usually responds to various environmental stresses. Hence, the evolution of TATA-box in duplicate genes may provide some clues for the interrelationship among environmental stress, expression differentiation, and duplicate gene preservation. In the present study, we observed that the TATA box is significantly overrepresented in duplicate genes compared with singletons in human, worm, Arabidopsis, and yeast genomes. We then conducted an extensive functional genomic analysis to investigate the evolution of TATA box along over 700 yeast gene family phylogenies. After reconstructing the ancestral TATA-box states (presence or absence), we found that significantly higher numbers of TATA box gain events than loss events had occurred after yeast gene duplications—the overall gain–loss ratio is about 3–4 to 1. Interestingly, these TATA-gain duplicate genes on average have experienced greater expression divergence from the ancestral expression states than their most closely related TATA-less duplicate partners, but only under environmental stress conditions (asymmetric evolution); indeed, under normal physiological conditions, they have similar expression divergence (symmetric evolution). Moreover, we showed that TATA-gain duplicates are enriched in stress-associated functional categories but that is not the case for TATA-ancestral duplicates (those inherited from their ancestors prior to duplication). Together, we conclude that after the gene duplication, gain of the TATA box in duplicate promoters may have played an important role in yeast duplicate preservation by accelerating expression divergence that may facilitate the adaptive evolution of the organism in response to environmental changes.},

  abstract = {Reduced activity of two genes in combination often has a more detrimental effect than expected. Such epistatic interactions not only occur when genes are mutated but also due to variation in gene expression, including among isogenic individuals in a controlled environment. We hypothesized that these ‘epigenetic’ epistatic interactions could place important constraints on the evolution of gene expression. Consistent with this, we show here that yeast genes with many epistatic interaction partners typically show low expression variation among isogenic individuals and low variation across different conditions. In addition, their expression tends to remain stable in response to the accumulation of mutations and only diverges slowly between strains and species. Yeast promoter architectures, the retention of gene duplicates, and the divergence of expression between humans and chimps are also consistent with selective pressure to reduce the likelihood of harmful epigenetic epistatic interactions. Based on these and previous analyses, we propose that the tight regulation of epistatic interaction network hubs makes an important contribution to the maintenance of a robust, ‘canalized’ phenotype. Moreover, that epigenetic epistatic interactions may contribute substantially to fitness defects when single genes are deleted. Harmful epistatic (genetic) interactions not only occur between mutations, but also when genes change in expression. Gene expression dynamics in yeast suggests that this ‘epigenetic’ epistasis constrains evolution, with the tight regulation of network hubs promoting a robust, ‘canalized’ phenotype.

This low expression variation is linked to the use of alternative promoter architectures.
